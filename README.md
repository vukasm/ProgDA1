# Assignment 2019
## Programming for Data Analysis

## Overview
This document contains the details on my assignment in which I will investigate numpy.random package in Python[1] for the Programming for Data Analysis module at GMIT[2]. [See the instructions here:](https://github.com/brianmcginley/ProgDA/blob/master/ProgDA_Assignment.pdf) <br/> 
For this assignment I will be using Jupyter[3] notebook where I will explain the package and some of the functions provided in it. <br/>
In Part I I will explain the overall purpose of the package. Part II will be concerned with the use of "Simple random data" and "Permutations functions". Furthermore, in Part III i will demonstrate the use and purpose of several "Distributions" functions and finally, Part IV will deal with the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.<br/>
